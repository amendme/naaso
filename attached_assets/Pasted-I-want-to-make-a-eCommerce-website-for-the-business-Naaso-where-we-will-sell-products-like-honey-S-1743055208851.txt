I want to make a eCommerce website for the business Naaso, where we will sell products like honey, Satu, apples, and other organic village products. Don't complicate the website—just keep a simple layout with a unique, clean design. Include a Blog section so the owner can post daily blogs on any topic, share updates about the farm, or provide product information. Other features should function like a standard eCommerce site. Keep the design minimalist and avoid unnecessary complexity. Use html, css and javascript only
For the homepage, include a slideshow of images with navigation arrows on each side. Add a button in one corner to play and stop a video.
Ensure the entire website is fully responsive on any device. The featured products section should display four products per row, with additional products moving to the next row. Include a section for customer testimonials and a top blog highlights section.
Make the hero section have an image slider. Make the arrows clickable so users can change the images. In the Latest Updates section, create small blog preview boxes with a "Read More" button leading to the full blog page. In the "Follow Us" section, add social media icons for Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook. Also, include a copyright notice: © 2025 in the footer.
In the hero section, the arrows should not be hidden; they should be fully visible and functional. Clicking them should change the image. The Latest Updates section should display example blog posts. In the "Our Story" video section, insert a sample video. When clicking the play button, blur the rest of the page and enlarge the video. Add a visible X button at the top of the video to return to the homepage.
Additionally, in the hero section, the images are only partially visible. Adjust them to cover the full width of the screen. The video section’s play button does not function correctly—it should blur the background and display the video properly. Also, fix the X button error so it correctly closes the video. Lastly, add a WhatsApp icon in the corner for instant contact with the owner, allowing users to buy directly.
